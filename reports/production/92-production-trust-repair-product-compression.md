| 2 | Scanner returns ITC multiple times with null scores | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Scanner cards show repeated "Research signals pending" | CRITICAL |
| 4 | Quote, chart, technical data conflict | HIGH |

| 7 | RSI/MACD calculations match series but series is stale | HIGH |
| 8 | Stock mobile pages too long and news-heavy | HIGH |
| 9 | News cards leak escaped Google News HTML | HIGH |
| 10 | Healthometer/research state inconsistent across engines | HIGH |
| 11 | Invest sheet stuck on "Loading research context" | HIGH |
| 12 | Portfolio/Watchlist/Alerts/Rankings weak/duplicated | HIGH |
| 13 | Bottom mobile nav cluttered, overlaps content | HIGH |
| 14 | Plain "StockStory.India" text branding instead of logo | MEDIUM |
| 15 | About/methodology low-contrast pale text | MEDIUM |
| 16 | Empty metric cards and dead panels reduce trust | MEDIUM |

## Scanner Data-Contract Failures

- No symbol deduplication
- Null scores returned as ranked results
- "Research signals pending" appears repeatedly
- ITC appears 5x in single result set
- No minimum data-quality gate
- Missing deterministic ranking

## Search Failures

- `RELIANCE` returns narrative results before company results
- No exact-symbol-match priority in ranking
- Company demoted below sector/narrative entities

## Quote/Chart/Technical Conflicts

- Quote price vs chart latest price mismatch
- `exchange: "Data unavailable"` displayed publicly
- Technical series stale/questionable
- Saturday-labelled market bar present in technical data
- Technical calculations correct but source series stale

## News Sanitation Failures

- Escaped Google News HTML (`&lt;a href=...`) leaks into UI
- No entity decoding
- No duplicate headline filtering
- No default cap on visible items

## Route/Product Duplication

- Watchlist, Portfolio, Alerts are 3 separate weak surfaces
- Rankings is standalone gated teaser with 3 rows
- No unified "Track" workflow
- Mobile nav has Watchlist but duplicates discovery paths
- Dashboard hub serves as catch-all

## Route Compression Plan

### Public routes (post-compression)

| Route | Page Key | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Home | `landing` / `dashboard` | Keep |
| AI Scanner | `scanner` | Keep, merge Rankings |
| Stock Research | `stock` / `company` | Keep |
| Compare | `compare` | Keep |
| Track | `track` | NEW — replaces watchlist/portfolio/alerts |
| Pricing | `pricing` | Keep |
| More | `more` | NEW — settings, legacy routes |

### De-emphasized from primary nav

| Route | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Rankings | Merged into Scanner as "Research shortlists" tab |
| Portfolio | Merged into Track |
| Watchlist | Merged into Track |
| Alerts | Merged into Track |
| Methodology | Moved to "More" / footer |
| IPO Center | Hidden from primary nav |
| Trust Centre | Moved to "More" |

### Mobile nav (new)

| Tab | Label | Action |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 1 | Home | `dashboard` |
| 2 | Scanner | `scanner` |
| 3 | Search | `search` |
| 4 | Track | `track` |
| 5 | More | `more` |

## Results

### Baseline
- **Commit:** `df81b39cf6a893895fc49755987137ad1392126f` (baseline) → `e3b2571c52b3de91cef9cb2cc92653d3647bfba2` (current)
- **typecheck:all:** PASS
- **lint:** PASS
- **test:unit:** 1619 passed, 0 failed (3 pre-existing failures now passing)
- **test:e2e:** 50/50 PASS
- **build:frontend:** PASS
- **build:backend:** PASS
- **validate:hygiene:** PASS

### Search Fix (Phase 8)
- `RELIANCE` search now promotes exact symbol match to position 1
- Ranking: exact symbol match (1000) → exact company name (900) → prefix (80) → contains (60) → alias/ISIN (50) → fuzzy → sector/narrative
- `RELIANCE`, `TCS`, `INFY`, `ITC`, `HDFCBANK` all resolve to correct company as top result

### Scanner Fix (Phase 6)
- Symbol deduplication via `Map` keyed on `symbol.trim().toUpperCase()`
- Null-score rows filtered out (filter method removes results where `score === null`)
- "Research signals pending" rows filtered out
- Results capped at 50
- Empty state: API returns `{ ok: true, data: [], message: "No companies..." }`

### Scanner UI (Phase 7)
- Uses `filteredResults` with local dedup (`seen` Set)
- Actions: Research, Compare, Track (no Buy/Sell/Hold, no Invest CTA)
- Score filter, sort, and category sections work
- No provider/backend wording

### Route Compression (Phase 3)
- Router maps `rankings` → `scanner` for redirect
- `track` and `more` page keys added to router
- `pricing`, `track`, `more`, `compare`, `terms` added to isPublicPage check

### PageRenderer Updates
- `TrackPage` and `MorePage` imported and handled in both public and authenticated render paths

### Track Page (Phase 4) — `src/pages/TrackPage.tsx`
- "Track your thesis" - Save companies, revisit changes
- Sections: Saved companies, What changed, Review queue
- Empty state with CTA to AI Scanner and Search
- Shows "Sign in to save companies" for unauthenticated
- No fake portfolio value, P&L, holdings, or alerts

### Rankings Merge (Phase 5)
- Router redirects `?page=rankings` → `scanner`
- E2E tests updated to expect scanner page instead of rankings
- PublicRankingsPage component remains for backward compatibility

### Navigation Updates (Phase 3, 17)
- **MobileNav:** Home, Scanner, Search, Track, More (5 tabs, no overlap)
- **TopNav:** Authenticated: Home, AI Scanner, Compare, Track, Pricing, More
- **TopNav:** Unauthenticated: Scanner, Product, Research Standards, Sign in, Get started
- **Sidebar:** Home, Search, AI Scanner, Track, Pricing, Settings

### Canonical Research State Resolver (Phase 9)
- Created `CanonicalResearchStateResolver.ts`
- Detects conflicts between engines
- Conflict labels: "High conviction", "Watch", "Needs review", "Risk rising", "Not enough information", "Partial research context"
- Prefers newest, most complete snapshot

### Health Truth Gate (Phase 11)
- `/readyz` now checks: DB connectivity, migrations, data coverage count, prediction count, pipeline freshness, critical tables present
- States: `ok`, `degraded`, `not_ready`
- Returns 503 when `not_ready`

### News Sanitation (Phase 12)
- Server-side `NewsSanitizer.ts` with:
  - HTML stripping (`stripHtmlTags`)
  - Entity decoding (`decodeHtmlEntities`)
  - Duplicate headline/source filtering (`deduplicateItems`)
  - URL extraction
  - Default max 20 items
- `StockNewsPanel.tsx` caps default visible items to 3
- "View all N stories" / "Show fewer" toggle on mobile

### Mobile Stock Page Compression (Phase 13)
- `StockStoryPageF0.tsx` already uses compact sections
- News panel caps at 3 items by default on mobile
- Stationary header with sticky chart, Healthometer, tabs
- Bottom padding accounts for nav height
- Invest CTA does not obscure bottom nav

### Invest Sheet Loading Fix (Phase 14)
- Opens instantly with cached snapshot from `sessionStorage`
- 2-second API timeout (down from 8s)
- If context missing: "Compare first" and "Track instead" CTAs
- No indefinite spinner
- `onTrack` → navigates to Track page
- `onCompare` → navigates to Compare page

### Logo/Header (Phase 15)
- `StockStoryLogo` component used in TopNav, Sidebar, MobileHeader, IntelligenceNavigationRail
- No plain `StockStory.India` text found in navigation
- Legal/Terms copy uses "StockStory India" (allowed exception)

### Contrast Fix (Phase 16)
- No pale text issues found in public pages audited
- Terms page uses `text-[#E8EDF2]` on dark background (sufficient contrast)

### Public-Copy Audit (Phase 18)
- Expanded with: `coverage`, `Jugaad`, `NSEPython`, Buy/Sell/Hold patterns
- 81 issues found (many in internal components, disclaimers)
- Script skips tests, reports, compliance, docs, internal/admin

### Audit Scripts (Phase 19)
- `scripts/audit-production-trust.ts` — /healthz, /readyz, scanner dedup, search quality, quote, news HTML
- `scripts/audit-search-quality.ts` — exact match priority for 5 queries
- `scripts/audit-scanner-quality.ts` — dedup, null scores, ITC counts across 5 presets
- `scripts/audit-market-data-consistency.ts` — quote validity, weekend bars
- `scripts/audit-news-sanitization.ts` — HTML leakage check
- Package scripts added: `audit:production-trust`, `audit:search-quality`, `audit:scanner-quality`, `audit:market-data-consistency`, `audit:news-sanitization`

### Tests (Phase 20)
- `tests/playwright/f2-navigation.spec.ts` — rankings redirect test updated
- `tests/playwright/f3-product-regression.spec.ts` — rankings → scanner tests updated
